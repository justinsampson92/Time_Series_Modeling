Time_Series_Modeling
====================

This project represents my efforts in Statistics 153: Time-Series Analysis Fall 2014 at UC Berkeley. For more information
please refer to the project write up. The data consists of webscraped text ran through a sentiment analyzer. It is then modeled 
using modern time-series techniques such as ARIMA.
